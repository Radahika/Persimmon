And it's said that college students never get machine shop certified in their freshman year...
After completing this test part today, I am cleared to work in the UC Berkeley MechE student shop! After spending at least an hour (or MUCH longer) almost every day of senior year in the DPEA machine shop, it was weird to go nearly five months without entering an active shop. (Despite that long layoff, I was still able to hold all the dimensions on the part to within a .002 inch tolerance; I was clearly taught well!)
Even though most of my time in the DPEA shop was spent watching other machinists at work, just being in that environment in the morning with the freshmen and in the evening for Robotics were some of the best parts of the day for me. There's just something refreshing about how much of a change of pace it is next to everything else that goes on, and I'm excited to have the chance to be back!
