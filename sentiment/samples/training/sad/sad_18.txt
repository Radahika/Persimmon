You sometimes think you want to disappear but all you really want is to
be found.

Sometimes it's better to just quietly and privately miss someone than to
let them know and still be ignored..... ! :(

That Sad Moment When Your Silence To Save Relation Consider As Your
Ego....

If someone breaks you as a person, dont worry! Someone else will help
you heal. And then they'll break you too. Cruel world. Get used to it.

It's sad when you realize you aren't as important to someone as you
thought you were

Its better to be lonely then to be played by wrong people.

Sometimes it's better to be Alone,Nobody can hurt you

It really hurtzz when sombody else starts taking your place in someone's
life... :(

Sometimes, you have to smile to hide your fears and laugh to hide your
tears

The worst kind of pain is when you're smiling to stop the tears from
falling :)

I used to think that the worst thing in life was to end up all alone,
it's not. The worst thing in life is the end up with people that make
you feel all alone !!!

I hate the fact that you ignore me for so long, and then you start
talking to me like nothing happened !! :l

I feel so far away from the one I wish to hold in my arms :(

The worst feeling is when you smile at your crush, but they don't even
acknowledge your existence...

I don't depend on people anymore because
I'm tired of being disappointed.
