proud

Some would say the Blue Banner says it all.
I personally don’t happen to think it says enough. Per usual this is coming about a week-and-a-half late, but I am so proud of this year’s students and all they accomplished on the way to Team 1717 winning the first-ever Ventura Regional with alliance captain Team 330 and third alliance partner Team 2761. The victory is well-deserved recognition for the students, but it was everything they achieved on and off the field on the long and winding road of the preceding three months that I am most impressed with from my perspective as a mentor; all the little victories along the way that weren’t heralded with a “swoosh”ing sound followed by numbers on a giant projector screen. So many things had to happen between the drive team, pit crew, scouting, and strategy on top of everything that happened in build season to make it possible.
I am particularly glad that the students got the chance to work alongside and learn from the consummate professionals of The Beach Bots. After seeing 1717 and 330 go head-to-head in eliminations the previous five events that both teams attended, I was glad to see the blue-and-yellow on the same side as the black-and-gold for the first time in a while!
That being said, there isn’t nearly enough space here to chronicle all that I saw along the way, and the Blue Banner has a certainly succinctness to it that my writing notably lacks.
Suffice it to say that we never do things the easy way---there was no shortage of suspense on that Sunday afternoon---but the students and mentors of Team 1717 and their alliance partners never let that stop them. I am beyond excited to have one more chance to work with this year’s cohort of students and mentors two weeks from now in St. Louis, and I look forward to seeing what they can accomplish on the World Championship stage!
