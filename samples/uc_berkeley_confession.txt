I'm graduating in a month and I'm both glad and scared. Berkeley destroyed me. When I came into this school, I was a happy, optimistic, driven and 95% functional human being. Then came the stress. Then the anxiety. Then the depression. To be honest I'm not quite sure how I limped my way through junior and senior year. Things were bad, but for the longest time I wouldn't admit it to myself. I isolated myself. I lost track of a lot of friends. I gave up on trying to find sex and romance because a series of bad experiences in sophomore year made me afraid of intimacy. My self esteem plummeted because my grades were bad because I was too mentally ill to deal with school, and this worsened my illness. I had trouble applying for internships because my low self esteem made me feel worthless, and I assumed defeat before even trying. I wouldn't take a semester off or ask for accommodations or help though because I was too stubborn, and I thought if I admitted I needed help I was being weak. I didn't tell people I interacted with and let them get angry with me for socially withdrawing. I thought I was worthless if I couldn't get through this, because other students didn't break like this.
I did end up getting help. I started medication and therapy at the beginning of this year, but even when things are better, things still aren't the way they were before I came to this school. And they aren't always better. It turns out medication doesn't magically fix you, it just makes it possible to function so long as nothing bad happens. I don't know if I'll ever go back to being the person I was before all this. It's funny, really. Berkeley was my dream school and it was supposed to be the best four years of my life. Instead, it wrecked me so thoroughly I don't know if I'll ever fully heal.
